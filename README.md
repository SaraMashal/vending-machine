# vending-machine
vending machine system using Java and OOP...
In this project I designed vending machine that consists of three actors, vendor is who will fill and refill the machine, a client and an angry client and both work the same just with few output changes, and both will request to select and buy an item.
At firs the vendor has to fill the machine with the item then he has to add price for each item respectivly.
Afterwards the client requests the item and proceeds to pay, so he gets the item he chose and the change left.
